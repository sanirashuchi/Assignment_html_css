        <h2>UI Design</h2>
        <p>
            It’s true that a UI or UX designers’ main aim is to enhance users’
            <br> satisfaction, by creating products and interfaces that are intuitive, 
            simple and efficient.
            <br> And many people have a part to play in this, including developers,
             content writers and more. But what exactly is each designer’s role within this overall aim?<br>
              In general terms, UI is about the visual design of the product interface.<br> Depending on the nature of the product,
               this normally includes the layout, <br>
            icons, buttons, information architecture, colors, typography, animations and illustrations.

        <h2>Web Devolopment</h2>
        <p>
            Web development is the building and maintenance of websites;<br> 
            it’s the work that happens behind the scenes to make a website look great, 
           <br> work fast and perform well with a seamless user experience.


           <br> Web developers, or ‘devs’, do this by using a variety of coding languages. 
            <br>The languages they use depends on the types of tasks they are preforming<br> and the platforms on which 
            they are working.

        <h2>App Devolopment</h2>
        <p>
            A mobile application, most commonly known as an app, <br>is a kind of application software intended to run on a mobile phone,
             for example, a smartphone or tablet PC. 
           <br> Mobile applications often serve to furnish clients with comparable administrations to those got to on PCs. 
            <br>Apps are by and large small, individual software units with restricted capacity. 
           <br> This utilization of application programming was initially advocated by Apple Inc. also, its App Store, 
           <br> which offers a huge number of uses for the iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch.
